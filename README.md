# Getting Started client readme

Sections:

• Introduction: the project’s goal and motivation.
• Technologies used (short).
• High-level components: Identify your project’s 3-5 main components. What is their role?
How are they correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text
with a link.
• Launch & Deployment: Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would
have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and
run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies
or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?
• Illustrations: In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s)
of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to
include a few screenshots of your application.
• Roadmap: The top 2-3 features that new developers who want to contribute to your project
could add.
• Authors and acknowledgment.
