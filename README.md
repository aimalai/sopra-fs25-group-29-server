## Introduction

Flicks & Friends üçø is your go-to platform for discovering, organizing, and enjoying movies and TV shows with friends. Whether you‚Äôre searching for new content, creating watch parties, or sharing recommendations, this app makes it easy to stay connected and entertained. Browse trending titles, manage watchlists, rate and review films, and experience synchronized watch parties‚Äîall in one place.

Driven by the increasing desire for community engagement and shared entertainment experiences, the app enables users to register, search titles via integrated APIs, rate and review what they watch, and organize virtual watch parties with friends, all from a single platform. Flicks & Friends aims to deliver a user-centric and collaborative experience.

Our primary motivation for choosing to work on this project is the lack of trustworthy recommendations that we see in the market ‚Äì in contrast, the customers of Flicks & Friends will be able to rely upon the recommendations of their own friends rather than the recommendations of someone they don‚Äôt know about.

## Launch & Deployment

### Commands to Build and Run Locally

#### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aimalai/sopra-fs25-group-29-server.git
```

#### Navigate to the server directory:

```sh
cd sopra-fs25-group-29-server
```

#### Build the backend project:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

#### Run the backend application:

```sh
./gradlew bootrun
```

The backend server should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### How to Run Tests:

```sh
./gradlew test
```

This will execute all unit and integration tests located in the `src/test/java` directory.  
Test results will be displayed in the console.

### Backend Dependencies

#### TV and Movies API

The application integrates with the **TMDB API** to fetch Movies and TV related data.

More information about the TMDB API key and token can be found in the `application.properties` file.

#### H2 Database (for development/testing):

```properties
server.port=8080
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.settings.web-allow-others=true
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

**Note:** The H2 console is available at [http://localhost:8080/h2-console/](http://localhost:8080/h2-console/) while the server is running.

### Plugins Used

The following plugins have been integrated into the backend project to support development, dependency management, and code quality:

-   **`org.springframework.boot`**  
    Provides Spring Boot support, enabling easy setup and management of the backend application.

-   **`io.spring.dependency-management`**  
    Efficiently manages project dependencies in Spring-based applications, ensuring version compatibility and stability.

-   **`java`**  
    Enables Java language support, allowing the application to be compiled and run as a standard Java project.

-   **`org.sonarqube`**  
    Integrates with SonarQube for automated code quality checks, helping maintain clean, secure, and maintainable code.
