## Introduction

Flicks & Friends üçø is your go-to platform for discovering, organizing, and enjoying movies and TV shows with friends. Whether you‚Äôre searching for new content, creating watch parties, or sharing recommendations, this app makes it easy to stay connected and entertained. Browse trending titles, manage watchlists, rate and review films, and experience synchronized watch parties‚Äîall in one place.

Driven by the increasing desire for community engagement and shared entertainment experiences, the app enables users to register, search titles via integrated APIs, rate and review what they watch, and organize virtual watch parties with friends, all from a single platform. Flicks & Friends aims to deliver a user-centric and collaborative experience.

Our primary motivation for choosing to work on this project is the lack of trustworthy recommendations that we see in the market ‚Äì in contrast, the customers of Flicks & Friends will be able to rely upon the recommendations of their own friends rather than the recommendations of someone they don‚Äôt know about.

## High-Level Components

Below are the 3 main components (i.e., functional groupings that have a focused responsibility) of our application's Backend:

### User Management

This component handles all operations related to user accounts, including creating users, retrieving user information, updating details, and managing authentication (login/logout). The central class for this component is <a href="src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/UserService.java" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">UserService</a>.

#### Key functionalities:

-   **User registration**:
    -   `createUser(User newUser)`: Creates a new user by generating a unique token, setting the initial status, validating the email, checking for duplicate usernames/emails, encoding the password, and sending a welcome email.
-   **User retrieval**:
    -   `getUsers()`: Retrieves all users from the database.
    -   `getUserById(Long userId)`: Retrieves a specific user by their ID.
-   **User updates**:
    -   `updateUser(Long userId, User userData)`: Allows users to modify their profiles, including username, password, birthday, email, and biography.
-   **Profile picture management**:
    -   `uploadProfilePicture(Long userId, MultipartFile file)`: Handles uploading and storing user profile pictures.
-   **Database interactions**:
    -   Managed using the `UserRepository` interface.

### User Authentication

This component verifies user identity and manages sessions, including login, OTP (One-Time Password) verification, and session handling. <a href="src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/controller/UserController.java" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">UserController</a> handles login and OTP verification endpoints, while <a href="src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/OTPService.java" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">OTPService</a> generates and verifies OTPs.

#### Key functionalities:

-   **Login**:
    -   `loginUser(UserPostDTO userPostDTO)`: Handles user login via `UserController`, validating credentials and setting the user's status to online. Also manages failed login attempts and account locking.
-   **Logout**:
    -   `logoutUser(Long userId)`: Sets the user‚Äôs status to offline.
-   **OTP management**:
    -   `sendOTP(Map<String, String> payload)`: Sends OTP for user authentication.
    -   `verifyOTP(Map<String, String> payload)`: Verifies OTP during login.
-   **Token authentication**:
    -   `getUserByToken(String token)`: Retrieves a user based on their authentication token.

### Friend and Watchlist Management

This component manages user friendships and movie watchlists. <a href="src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/UserService.java" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">UserService</a> handles friend requests, accepting/declining them, retrieving friend lists, and managing movie additions/removals from watchlists. <a href="src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/controller/UserController.java" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">UserController</a> exposes API endpoints for these functionalities.

#### Key functionalities:

**Watchlist management**:

-   `addMovieToWatchlist(Long userId, String jsonString)`: Adds a movieüçø to a user's watchlist.
-   `getWatchlist(Long userId)`: Retrieves the user's watchlist.
-   `removeMovieFromWatchlist(Long userId, String movieId)`: Removes a movie from the user's watchlist.

**Friend request management**:

-   `sendFriendRequest(Long targetUserId, Long fromUserId)`: Sends a friend request.
-   `acceptFriendRequest(Long targetUserId, Long fromUserId)`: Accepts a friend request.
-   `declineFriendRequest(Long targetUserId, Long fromUserId)`: Declines a friend request.
-   `getFriendRequests(Long userId)`: Retrieves the list of friend requests for a user.

**Friend list management**:

-   `getFriends(Long userId)`: Retrieves a user's friends list.
-   `removeFriend(Long userId, Long friendId)`: Removes a friend from the user's list.

**Friend status verification**:

-   `areFriends(Long userId, Long otherUserId)`: Checks if two users are friends.

## Launch & Deployment

### Commands to Build and Run Locally

#### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aimalai/sopra-fs25-group-29-server.git
cd sopra-fs25-group-29-server
```

#### Navigate to the backend directory:

```sh
cd backend
```

#### Build the backend project:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

#### Run the backend application:
